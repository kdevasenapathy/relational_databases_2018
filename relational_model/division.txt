-- [Problem 1a]
PI[R MINUS S](r) MINUS PI[R MINUS S]((PI[R MINUS S](r) CROSS s)	MINUS PI[R MINUS S, S](r));
-- If we put in the values for monkey_likes and monkey_foods we see
PI[name](monkey_likes) MINUS PI[name]((PI[name](monkey_likes) CROSS monkey_foods) MINUS PI[name, foods](monkey_likes));

-- All the tuples in the expression
(PI[name](monkey_likes) CROSS monkey_foods) MINUS PI[name, food](monkey_likes);
-- will be the tuples of monkeys with the foods they do not like
-- that are also in monkey_foods. At this point, any foods in the
-- monkey_likes.food that are not in monkey_foods.food get disposed of
-- because set subtraction results in all the results in monkey_foods that are
-- not in monkey_likes.food, but not the ones in monkey_likes.food but not in
-- monkey_foods--this is how tofu gets removed from the relation
PI[name]((PI[name](monkey_likes) CROSS monkey_foods) MINUS PI[name, food](monkey_likes));
-- will give us all the monkeys who don't like one of the foods in monkey_foods,
-- so the full expression gives us the names of all the monkeys who do like
-- all of the foods in monkey_foods, which because tofu was removed in the
-- set subtraction does not preclude the names of monkeys who liked all the foods
-- in monkey_foods and more. Thus, Guenter is included.

-- [Problem 1b]
-- Define exact division
PI[R MINUS S](r) MINUS PI[R MINUS S]((PI[R MINUS S](r) CROSS s)	MINUS PI[R MINUS S,S](r));
-- We saw in the previous example that set subtraction caused the
-- extraneous tuples in r to be removed. In this case,
r MINUS (s INTERSECT r);
-- which is why the things in s that are not in r are not included
-- we can retain them by instead doing
(r UNION s) MINUS (r INTERSECT s);
--Applying this to the division problem, we can replace the set difference with
PI[R MINUS S](r) MINUS PI[R MINUS S](((PI[R MINUS S](r) CROSS s)UNION PI[R MINUS S,S](r)) MINUS ((PI[R MINUS S](r) CROSS s)	INTERSECT PI[R MINUS S,S](r)));
-- This change will include Guenter in the subtracted expression, thereby
-- resulting in his removal from the final expression
