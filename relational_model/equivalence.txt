-- [Problem 1a]
SIGMA[theta]([A] GROUP [F](r)) = [A] GROUP [F](SIGMA[theta](r));
-- The two expressions are equivalent.
-- is a selection of an aggregation of attributes that A has.
-- Given that the attributes used in theta must be within A, the grouping
-- attributes, we know that they will not be operated on by F in [A] GROUP [F](r)
-- Consequently, whatever selection criterion SIGMA[theta] is imposing
-- is unchanged by [A] GROUP [F] either, because the two operations are
-- working on mutually exclusive sets of attributes within r.
-- Since they are never operating on the same attributes, the order in which
-- they occur does not matter, and thus, the two are equivalent.

-- [Problem 1b]
PI[A](r - s) != PI[A](r) - PI[A](s)
-- The two expressions are not equivalent
--Example: Let r = {(a, b), (a, c)}, s = {(a, b), (a, d)}
PI[A](r - s) = PI[A] {(a, c)} = a;
PI[A](r) - PI[A](s) = {a} - {a} = {};
--These are clearly not equivalent.

-- [Problem 1c]
(r LBOWTIE s) LBOWTIE t != r LBOWTIE (s LBOWTIE t)
--The two expressions are not equivalent.
--Example: Let r = {(a, b), (c, d), (e, f)}, s = {(a, x), (c, y)}, and t = {(a, n), (e, z)}
-- r LBOWTIE s = {(a, b, x), (c, d, y), (e, f, null)} LBOWTIE t = {(a, b, x, n), (c, d, y, null), (e, f, null, z)}
-- s LBOWTIE t = {(a, x, n), (c, y, null)} and r LBOWTIE (s LBOWTIE t) = {(a, b, x, n), (c, d, y, null), (e, f, null, null)}
-- As can be seen, the common value of e between r and t is dropped.

-- [Problem 1d]
SIGMA[theta](r LBOWTIE s) = SIGMA[theta](r) LBOWTIE s
-- The two expressions are equivalent.
-- Given that theta only utilizes attributes within r, we know that it will
-- not be operating on any of the attributes within s.
-- We also see that because r and s are being left outer joined, all of the
-- tuples in r will be retained with the corresponding attributes in s
-- simply appended on. As such, SIGMA[theta] (r) will pull out the same
-- tuples as SIGMA[theta] (r LBOWTIE s), so it's irrelevant whether we
-- append the attributes in s before or after the selection.
--Thus, the two are equivalent.

-- [Problem 1e]
SIGMA[theta](r LBOWTIE s) != r LBOWTIE SIGMA[theta](s)
-- The two expressions are not equivalent.
--Example: Let r = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, c)}, s = {(1, 9), (3, 15), (4, 35)}, theta = s2 > 12
--r LBOWTIE s = {(1, a, 9), (2, b, null), (3, c, 15)}
--SIGMA[s2>12] (r LBOWTIE s) = {(3, c, 15)} since null > 12? evaluates to unknown
--SIGMA[s2>12](s) = {(3, 15), (4, 35)}
-- r LBOWTIE SIGMA[s2>12](s) = {(1, a, null), (2, b, null), (3, c, 15)}
-- Clearly the two differ, so they are not equivalent
